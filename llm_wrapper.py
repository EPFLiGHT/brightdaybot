          DO NOT use custom emojis like :birthday_party_parrot: or :rave: as they may not exist in all workspaces
        - DO NOT use Unicode emojis (like ðŸŽ‚) - ONLY use Slack format with colons (:cake:)
        
        When writing your message:
        1. Be {personality["style"]}
        2. Use plenty of Slack formatting (bold, italics) and STANDARD Slack emojis only; don't use double asterisks for bold, use *text* instead
        3. Include fun wordplay, puns, or jokes based on their name if possible
        4. Reference their star sign with a humorous "prediction" or trait if provided
        5. If age is provided, include a funny age-related joke or milestone
        6. {personality["format_instruction"]}
        7. Always address the entire channel with <!channel> to notify everyone
        8. Include a question about how they plan to celebrate
        9. Don't mention that you're an AI

        Slack formatting examples:
        - Bold: *text*  
        - Italic: _text_
        - Strikethrough: ~text~
