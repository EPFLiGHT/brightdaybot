## Customization

### Changing Birthday Message Style

**NEW: Centralized Personality Configuration** 🎨

All personality configurations are now centralized in `personality_config.py` for easy management:

- **`personality_config.py`** - Complete personality definitions including:
  - Basic info (name, description, style)
  - Message generation templates and prompts
  - Image generation prompts
  - Web search formatting
  - Consolidated message prompts

**Adding a New Personality:**

**Legacy Configuration:**
- `BASE_TEMPLATE` - The core template all personalities share (in config.py)
- `BACKUP_MESSAGES` - Fallback templates when AI is unavailable (in utils/message_generator.py)

### Schedule Configuration

The bot now uses a sophisticated multi-timezone celebration system:

- **Hourly Checks**: Runs at :00 past each hour to check for 9 AM celebrations in different timezones
- **Daily Safety Net**: Runs at 10:00 AM in server local timezone as a backup (configurable via `DAILY_CHECK_TIME` in config.py)
- **Startup Recovery**: Automatically catches missed celebrations when the bot restarts after downtime
- **Smart Consolidation**: When multiple people have birthdays on the same day, the first person hitting 9 AM triggers a single consolidated message for everyone

### AI Image Generation

**Enhanced Image Generation** 🖼️

The bot can generate personalized birthday images using OpenAI's GPT-Image-1 model with new advanced features:

- **Personality-Themed Images**: Each bot personality generates images in its unique style (configured in `personality_config.py`)
- **Message Context Integration**: Images now incorporate themes from the generated birthday message
- **Profile Photo Face Detection**: Automatically includes the person's face in the image if they have a profile photo
- **Creative Randomness**: AI adds unexpected creative elements to make each image unique
- **Profile Integration**: Uses user's job title and profile information for personalization
- **Automatic Caching**: Images are saved to `data/cache/images/` directory with automatic cleanup

  - Cached data is stored in `data/cache/` directory
  - Control caching with `WEB_SEARCH_CACHE_ENABLED` environment variable
  - Clear cache with `admin cache clear` or manually delete cache files
- **Image Caching**: Auto-saves generated birthday images to `data/cache/images/`
  - Automatic cleanup removes images older than 30 days
  - Manual cleanup can be performed by deleting files from the cache directory
- **Administrative Control**: Provides commands for manual backup and restore operations
- **Multi-Timezone Birthday Tracking**: Prevents duplicate announcements across different celebration methods
  - Legacy tracking: `data/tracking/announced_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
  - Timezone tracking: `data/tracking/timezone_announced_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`

## Enhanced Logging System

**NEW: Component-Specific Logging** 📝

- **API Configuration**: Validates that required API keys are configured

To check system health:

1. As an admin, use the command: `admin status`
2. For detailed information including file paths and cache details: `admin status detailed`

The health check helps diagnose issues quickly by showing the status of each component with visual indicators:

- ✅ Component is working correctly
- ℹ️ Component has a non-critical status
- ❌ Component has a critical issue that needs attention

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with BrightDayBot, follow these steps:

1. Run the health check with `admin status` command in Slack
2. Check for any ❌ indicators in the status report
3. For more detailed diagnostics, use `admin status detailed`
4. Verify all required environment variables are set correctly
5. Ensure the bot has proper permissions in Slack
6. Check that all required directories and files exist with proper permissions
7. Review the component-specific log files in `data/logs/` for error messages:
   - `main.log` - Core application logs
   - `commands.log` - User commands and admin actions
   - `events.log` - Slack events
   - `birthday.log` - Birthday service logic
   - `ai.log` - AI/LLM interactions
   - `slack.log` - Slack API interactions
   - `storage.log` - Data storage operations
   - `system.log` - System utilities and health checks
   - `scheduler.log` - Scheduling and background tasks

Common issues:

- Missing API keys: Ensure `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set
- Permission problems: Verify the bot has read/write permissions to the data directories
- Invalid configuration: Check that the `BIRTHDAY_CHANNEL` is set to a valid Slack channel ID
- Image generation issues: Verify OpenAI API key has access to GPT-Image-1 model
- Timezone issues: Ensure users have set their timezone in their Slack profile settings
- Missing dependencies: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages including `pytz` and `Pillow`
